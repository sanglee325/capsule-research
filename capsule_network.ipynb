    "# Capsule Network\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I'll be building a simple Capsule Network that aims to classify MNIST images. This is an implementation in PyTorch and this notebook assumes that you are already familiar with [convolutional and fully-connected layers](https://cezannec.github.io/Convolutional_Neural_Networks/). \n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Capsules?\n",
    "\n",
    "Capsules are a small group of neurons that have a few key traits:\n",
    ">* Each neuron in a capsule represents various properties of a particular image part; properties like a parts color, width, etc. \n",
    "* Every capsule **outputs a vector**, which has some magnitude (that represents the probability of a part's **existence**) and orientation (that represents a part's generalized pose).\n",
    "* A capsule network is made of multiple layers of capsules; during training, this network aims to learn the spatial relationships between the parts and whole of an object (ex. how the position of eyes and a nose relate to the position of a whole face in an image).\n",
    "* Capsules represent relationships between parts of a whole object by using **dynamic routing** to weight the connections between one layer of capsules and the next and creating strong connections between spatially-related object parts. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='assets/cat_face_2.png' width=50% />\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read more about all of these traits in [my blog post about capsules and dynamic routing](https://cezannec.github.io/Capsule_Networks/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Representing Relationships Between Parts\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these traits allow capsules to communicate with each other and determine how data moves through them. Using dynamic communication, during the training process, a capsule network learns the **spatial relationships** between visual parts and their wholes (ex. between eyes, a nose, and a mouth on a face). When compared to a vanilla CNN, this knowledge about spatial relationships makes it easier for a capsule network to identify an object no matter what orientation it is in. These networks are also better able to identify multiple, overlapping objects, and learn from smaller sets of training data! \n",

    "The Capsule Network that I'll define is made of two main parts:\n",
    "1. A convolutional encoder\n",
    "2. A fully-connected, linear decoder\n",

    "I'll be following the architecture described [in the original Capsule Network paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.09829.pdf). I'll describe each layer in more detail as I define it in this notebook, but first let's load in our resources and MNIST data. I'm also setting a random seed, for reproducibility."

For each possible parent, a child capsule computes a prediction vector, $\\hat{u}$, which is a function of its output vector, $u$, times a weight matrix, $W$. $W$ represents a linear transformation in space—like some rotation and translation—$\\hat{u}$ can be thought of as a prediction about the position and orientation of a parent capsule's output vector.\n",
    "3. If the prediction vector, $\\hat{u}$, has a large **dot product** with the parent capsule output vector, $v$, then those vectors are said to **agree** and the coupling coefficient between *that* parent and the child capsule increases while the coupling coefficient between that child capsule and *all other* parents, decreases.\n",
    "4. This dot product between the parent output vector, $v$, and a prediction vector, $\\hat{u}$, is known as a formal measure of capsule **agreement**, $a$.\n",

    "## Custom Loss\n",
    "\n",
    "To prepare for training the model, I'll need to define a custom loss. The loss for a capsule network is a weighted combination of **two** losses:\n",
    "1. The **margin loss** that looks at the outputs of *all* the digit capsules and computes a loss term that is dependent on whether or not the selected \"correct\" digit capsule matches the correct class label.\n",
    "2. The **reconstruction loss** that looks at the original input images and how they differ from the decoder's produced, reconstructed images. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reconstruction loss is a simple mean squared error loss, which I will calculate as `nn.MSELoss`. And I explained that this acts as a kind of [regularization method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_(mathematics)), above. By regularization, I mean that it forces the 16 dimensions (in the output vectors from the `DigitCaps` layer) to correspond to meaningful content information; information that can then be used to *reconstruct* the original image. It is important to note that the authors of the original Capsule Net paper weighted this loss with a coefficient of `0.0005`, so that it wouldn't overpower the margin loss, and that is reflected in the code below.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, I really want to focus on describing this new type of loss, the margin loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Margin Loss\n",
    "\n",
    "Margin loss is a classification loss that is based on the length of the output vectors coming from the `DigitCaps` layer. Recall that the magnitude of a capsule output vector is a measure of a part's **existence**. So, for any input image of a handwritten digit, we want *one* particular digit capsule to output a long vector, indicating confidence in one particular digit class! This capsule is sometimes referred to as the \"correct\" capsule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Margin loss formalizes this idea; it says that if a certain digit (in this case a digit 0-9) is present in an image then the squared length of the corresponding output vector of that digit capsule must not be less than 0.9. So, if I have an input image of a 0, then the \"correct,\" zero-detecting, digit capsule should output a vector of magnitude 0.9 or greater! For all the other digits (1-9, in this example) the corresponding digit capsule output vectors should have a magnitude that is 0.1 or less.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $x$ is the the output vector of the digit capsule for class $c$ (0-9). \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if an image of class $c$ is present then the magnitude of $x$ should be equal to or greater than 0.9. The magnitude is the square root of a squared value, and I'll call that magnitude $v_c = \\sqrt{x^2}$, so $v_c >=0.9$. Similarly, if the class $c$ digit is *not* present in an image, then $v_c <=0.1$.  These values will be summed together to calculate the total, margin loss. Which you can see in the following formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L_c = T_c(\\max[0, 0.9-v_c]) + \\lambda (1-T_c)(\\max[0, v_c-0.1])$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $T_c$ is a label 0 or 1 indicating whether a digit capsule vector is \"correct\" (1) or not (0). And $\\lambda$ is a value we choose for training; the researchers chose a value of `0.5`. These choices are reflected in the code below, *and* I'm using a ReLu function to get the maximum of 0 and another value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This loss will encourage our model to make the index of the \"correct\" capsule match the true class label of a given training image.\n"

    "In the [capsule network paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.09829.pdf), they have a section that compares the performance of a capsule network and a vanilla CNN. One observation is that a capsule network is more robust to affine transformations in data. That is, even when the network is trained on normal MNIST data, if you then translate or rotate some test data, a trained CapsNet will perform better than a vanilla CNN.\n",

    "> Experiments show that each DigitCaps capsule learns a more robust representation for each class than a traditional convolutional network. Because there is natural variance in skew, rotation, style, etc. in hand written digits, the trained CapsNet is moderately robust to small affine transformations of the training data.\n",

    "Their process for creating affine-transformed test data is different than mine, but I wanted to see how well my trained capsule network performed on randomly, affine-transformed data.
